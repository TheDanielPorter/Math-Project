<h2> More Information about each place </h2> 
<br>
<h3>Washington D.C </h3>
For Washington DC the goal was to learn more about history and to see cherry blossom trees. "The most popular place to visit the cherry blossom trees is at the Tidal Basin, which provides great photo ops near the Jefferson Memorial, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial."(“Things to Know about the Cherry Blossoms in Washington, DC: Washington DC.”)In Washington DC there are cherry blossoms and several memorials so I can knock off 2 goals at one time. In Washington DC they have a "National Cherry Blossom Festival (March 20 – April 17) is a citywide event that celebrates the 1912 gift of 3,000 cherry blossom trees to Washington, DC by the mayor of Tokyo. This year's festival features a range of spectacular celebrations, including the Opening Ceremony (March 20), the Blossom Kite Festival (March 26), the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade (April 9) and Petalpalooza (April 16) . Local restaurants even get into the spirit with the Cherry Picks program, while DC-area hotels offer blossom-themed packages, deals and discounts."(“Things to Know about the Cherry Blossoms in Washington, DC: Washington DC.”) They are also several events to go if we go in the spring. A picture is below from <a href=”Washin.html” > a website. Click here to go to the website. </a>

<h3> Las Vegas  </h3>
<p> The Slotzilla Zip Line is in the Fremont district. "SlotZilla is a 11-story slot machine-inspired zip line attraction."("Official Site of the Slotzilla Zip Line in Downtown Las Vegas.") There are two types of ziplines in Slotzilla, the Zip-Zilla that"launches from a platform 77 feet in the air. Flyers will be in a seated position and land halfway down the Fremont Street Experience pedestrian promenade."("Official Site of the Slotzilla Zip Line in Downtown Las Vegas.") This is one type of zipline that will help you get from one side of the Fremont district to halfway of the Fremont district while having fun. The other type of Zipline is the Super Hero Zoom which "launches from a platform more than 10 stories up on in the air (114 feet) and whisks flyers 1,750 feet."("Official Site of the Slotzilla Zip Line in Downtown Las Vegas.") This zoomline launches flyers from a higher distance than the Zip-Zilla and has a longer distance. It also sends"flyers prone, or “superhero-style,” for an unprecedented view of the party that never ends at Fremont Street Experience."("Official Site of the Slotzilla Zip Line in Downtown Las Vegas.") Not only will you be able to zipline you can also zipline in a superhero style while looking down at the Fremont district. You can also"travel down the zip lines at up to 40 miles per hour."("Official Site of the Slotzilla Zip Line in Downtown Las Vegas.") Below are some pictures.

<h3>Charleston</h3>
<p> Two of the things Charleston has that's unique to itself is paddleboarding and their views from their Cherrywood BBQ & Ale House. "Paddleboarding is one of the best ways to explore Charleston’s waterways, and paddleboarding by moonlight is one of the best things to do in Charleston, SC, at night!"(“10 Of the Most Unique Things to Do in Charleston, SC | Pam ...”) The view you get by Paddle boarding in the moonlight is relaxing and beautiful at the same time. Another great view can be seen by the"Cherrywood BBQ & Ale House. Here, you can enjoy beautiful views of Kiawah Island’s Osprey Point Golf Course. One of our favorite pastimes is sitting on the open veranda and watching the alligators make their way across the course! Craft beer, Southern-style barbecue, colorful salads, and signature sauces are all on the menu."(“10 Of the Most Unique Things to Do in Charleston, SC | Pam ...”) You can eat some Southern style foods while watching golf matches and animals. That's a nice way to relax! Below are two pictures. The first is taken from <a href=”https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.guideadvisor.com%2Ftrips%2Fsup-glow-night-tours-paddleboarding-charleston-sc-usa%2F&psig=AOvVaw03kO7ih5miBuC-vFKajOkd&ust=1646124365635000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCPi25aOBovYCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ” “target=”_blank”> this website </a> and the second is taken from <a href=”https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkiawahresort.com%2Fdining%2Fcherrywood-bbq-and-ale-house%2F&psig=AOvVaw3GwNwkImryBcp9X1utkEQG&ust=1646124564996000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCIiq-4eCovYCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAf” “target=”_blank”> this website </a></p>

<h3>  Los Angeles</h3>
<p> The Los Angeles zoo has several plants in it. The "gardens boast an incredible array of plants from all over the globe — from Hong Kong orchid trees to Mexican fan palms."(Plants) "Landscaping plants dominate, adding visual interest and helping to create geographically appropriate settings for the animal habitats." (Plants) "Additionally, the Zoo’s plant collection includes many intriguing specimen plants—examples of unusual or distinctive species such as the Chilean wine palm". "The native gardens present many of Southern California’s spectacular indigenous plants" (Plants)"With our bird gardens, the Los Angeles Zoo is inviting our wild feathered neighbors- and migratory visitors- to make themselves at home." (Plants) The Los Angeles Zoo has plants from everywhere. Is a Zoo that actually has animals,plants, and exhibits. Has rare and ancient species of plants. There's also plants that are native to great looking plants. They're are also bird gardens, so you can look at birds you've never seen before.

<h3> Why did we each choose our location?</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<th bgcolor="pink">Jeannete’s reason </th>
<th bgcolor=" light blue">Daniel’s reason </th>
<th bgcolor="green"> Madisen’s reason </th>
<th bgcolor="yellow"> Joshua’s reason </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="pink">Jeanette chose Washington D.C because "the capital is because I've been wanting to go there for a long time. It seems like a rather chill place where I can explore the history of the nation, which would be fun because I find American history to be fascinating. Also, seeing the cherry trees bloom would be an experience I'd never forget!" </td>
<td bgcolor="light blue"> "I was originally going to choose the Dominican Republic or Puerto Rico but that was not in the U.S. So I thought about places in the US I went to and had fun in. One of those places was Las Vegas and no one in my group chose Las Vegas so I thought I should do my project on Las Vegas." </td>
<td bgcolor="green"> Madisen chose Charleston because "it was were my grandfather on my mothers side use to live and we traveled down there for his funeral and I felt safe and the weather when we were down there was perfect because the storm that we had in 8th grade that had busses stuck outside for hours on hours was in a lot of other states but it wasn’t in Charleston."</td>
<td bgcolor="yellow"> Joshua chose Los Angeles because "it is named as the city of sun and it is just seems like a fun place to lose and gain money and just like a break from the world everything there just seems so fast paced but in a good way always exciting."</td>

<p>1. How did we get our equations? </p>


<p> We got the original sin function by plugging in the monthly temperatures into our Ti-84 calculator. We found the inverse equations by hand with each other. We found the quadratic equation by calculator as well.</p>


<p>2.How did we get our graphs? </p> 


<p> We got our graphs from desmos.com and google sheets. </p>
